# Property Listing Web Application

This project is a web application that provides property listings for sale or rent, with features including user authentication, AI-driven property recommendations, and a responsive design. The application is designed to offer users an intuitive and personalized experience.

## Problem Statement

### 1. Page Requirements
- **Design and implement at least three pages** in line with a chosen theme for the property listing application.

### 2. User Authentication Flow
- **Login and Logout:** Implement a secure user authentication flow, allowing users to log in and out. This flow interacts with a database using one of the specified backend technologies: Node.js, Python, Java, or Golang.

### 3. Property Listing Page
- **Property Listings:** Develop a page where users can view detailed listings of properties available for sale or rent. The property data should be dynamically fetched from a database.

### 4. AI-Driven Property Recommendations
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Implement an AI algorithm that suggests properties to users based on their browsing history and preferences. The algorithm should enhance user experience by providing personalized property recommendations.
- **Note:** Dummy data or data sourced from the internet can be used.

### 5. Responsive Design
- **Cross-Device Compatibility:** Ensure that all pages are fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
